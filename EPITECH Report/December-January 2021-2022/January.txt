Are your classes online, or face-to-face, or hybrid (mix of online and face-to-face)?

All of my classes this semester are in person.

 
-On average, how many students are attending the classes?

Arround 20 to 40 students per courses.

 
-Campus equipment: what do you have access to? (Library, sport center, etc)
 
Everybody got acces to the library, computer labs.
I don t know about the gym but I m assuming its the same.


-Did your University offer any Christmas/New Yearâ€™s Eve related activities or events (Christmas hamper, Secret Santa, International students lunch or dinner)

I went back to france during chrismas / new year, so I dont know.
However I'm sure they must have had plenty of event going on since there is always event going on.

 
-Pedagogical point: how did your exams go? Are there any students facing difficulties? Please give as many details as you can.

Nothing new since the last report about the exam.

 
- If you have enrolled to new courses for the second semester, do they comply with Tekfeed? If not, please let us know so that we can update the list to better inform future Tek4s.

Only 1 class is the follow up of a previous course. The other 3 are differents.
Since it was a new university tekfeed was pretty empty about the courses last year.
To be honest I'm still not sure what courses I was allowed to take.
Best to get the whole list of the courses available would be to contact Mrs Naranjo or Mrs Del Sol from FIU.

 
-You have now spent half a year abroad. What is your overall feeling? Do you feel more open minded? More independent? Even though Covid 19 is affecting your mobility abroad, were you able to learn new things about yourself? 

Overall feeling after half a year in miami is pretty simple : life here is 10x better than in Paris and covid make it 20x better than in France lol ðŸ™‚
No mask (except for bus), no covid pass needed anywhere.
