Has everyone integrated well? Are there any students who are having difficulties (in terms of courses but also in terms of adapting to life in the country) ?

Trimester is not yet over but so far no difficulties on the courses.
In term of adapting to life here, its not much different from France, so it wasn t too hard to adapt.

  
Perhaps you have already had mid-term exams: how did it go?
Do you have any concerns about midterms ? Have you received information about the exams and what will be the evaluation methods at the end of the semester (submission of files, continuous assessment, table exams, catch-up exams...) ?

Personnally midterm went well. We got finalterm next week (starting 6th of december)

Every courses got MidTerm and FinalTerm. They work the same :
	- 1 project/exercise to do at home.
	- Exam in person either on computer or paper.
Depanding on the class result teacher can decide to curve the result (+0 / +10 / +20 etc...)

All of my courses are using the Canvas app/website to publish everything (lessons, homework, calendar, grades, exercise etc...) which is really easy to use.
Of course every grades (homework, midterm, project etc...) during the semester count toward the courses grades.


So far, what are the easiest and what are the most difficult courses that you are following and why ?

The math class (MAD 2105) is the hardest by far. I wouldn't recommend it if you never done math post bac.
Other than that the courses I m taking are pretty easy. (COP 1000 - COP 2250 - COP 3835)

Every courses available at FIU can be found here : https://m.fiu.edu/catalog/index.php
Or on the FIU mobile app, course catalog.
Of course not every class listed here can be taken.


Are you interacting with local students at your university ?

Most (like 99.99%) of the students in my classes and I m talking to are from the USA.
For exemple I got no class with an other french student, most of the other french people here are from buisness school.
