Ex 1. How many vertices and how many edges do these graphs have ?

a) Kn

Kn has n vertices.
Kn has n(n-1)/2 edges.

b) Cn

Cn has n vertices.
Cn has n edges.

c) Wn

Wn has n + 1 vertices.
Wn has 2 * n edges

d) Km,n

Km,n has m + n vertices.
Km,n has m * n edges.


Ex 3. For which values of n are these graphs regular?

a) Kn

Kn is a complete graph.
Kn is always regular for all n and will be a graph of degree n-1.  

b) Cn

Cn is cyclic graph
Cn is always regular for all n values and is a graphs of degree 2.

c) Wn

Wn is wheel graph
Wn is regular for n = 3 and is a graph of degree 3.


Ex 4. For which values of m and n is Km,n regular?

Km,n is regular for m = n and is a graph of degree m.


Ex 7. If G is a simple graph with 15 edges and GÂ¯ has 13 edges, how many vertices does G have?

We know that G U G' are complete Graph Kn. So, G+G' = 15+13 = 28

Total number of edges in the complete graph is nC2
nC2 = (n(n-1))/2 = 28 

By solving the equation we get n= 8 
Therefore the number of vertices, n = 8


Ex 8.

a)

A    B     A --- B
 \  /       \
   C          C

These two graphs are isomorphic.

b) 

The two matrix doesn t have the same ammount of edges.
Therefor they are not isomorphic.

c)

The two matrix doesn t have the same ammout of edges.
Therefor they are not isomorphic.


Ex 9.

1) this graph doesn t have an Euler circuit not a Euler path.

2) This graph got an Euler path :
	d -> g -> h -> i -> f -> e -> h -> f -> c -> b -> a -> d -> e -> b -> d

3) This graph doesn t have an Euler circuit but got an Euler path :
	a -> b -> e -> b -> d -> e -> a -> c -> e -> c -> d

4) This graph goesn t have an Euler circuit but has an Euler path :
	f -> b -> c -> d -> b -> a -> e -> d -> a -> f -> e -> c

5) This graph got an Euler circuit : 
	a -> e -> a -> e -> c -> d -> e -> b -> d -> c -> b -> a


Ex 10.

First graph : a           d
              | \       / |
              |   c -- f  |
              | /       \ |
              b           e

Hamilton circuit : a -> b -> c -> f -> d -> e

Second graph : a --- b
               |   / | \
               |  /  |  c
               | /   | /
               e --- d

Hamilton circuit : a -> e ->  b -> d -> c

Third graph : a --- b
              | \ / |
              |  c  |
              |   \ |
              e --- d --- f

Hamilton circuit : f -> d -> b -> c -> a -> e

Fourth graph :       a --- b --- g
                     | \ / |
                     |  x  |
                     |/  \ |
               e --- c --- d --- f

There is no hamilton path on the graph because there is 3 vertice with only 1 edge.
